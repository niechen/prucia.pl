# About me

My name is Piotr. Professionally I'm an Android developer and tech lead working in [Pegasystems](https://www.pega.com){:target="_blank"} where I am responsible for developing our core mobile product.

Besides working I'm a keen cyclist and a book reader.

This is my online business card and soon to be a blog where I'm going to share my thoughts on mobile development. Feel free to drop me @ line.
